\section{Overview of the Project}
\subsection{Background Story}
The story of the game is about a space expedition. Our player is on a long journey and space ship begins malfunctioning. Different subsystems start failing and security system begins to malfunction. The whole crew of the ship is in stasis and unaware of the situation. The player controls the maintenance droid.  This maintenance droid is the only unaffected robot or computer on the ship. His task is to restore power to ship's subsystem and fixing the security system. Now the ship's fate is in the hands of this humble maintenance droid.
\subsection{Theme}
This is the International Year of Light and Light-based Technologies, 2015. This is a United Nations observance that aims to raise awareness of the achievements of light science and its applications and importance.\\

This game accounts this year's theme of light. When the space ship is wrecked and malfunctions, it looses all its power sources and light. Our maintenance robot switches on the power and brings back light to each room of each part of the space ship during the game-play.\\

Different part(level) of the ship begin dark. As our droid explores the level, he returns power to different components. As the components turned on, the ship begins to lit back up. 
\subsection{Initial Design}
This is an exploration based platformer 2D game. The initial design focused on the randomised level generation. This aspect of the game-play is inspired from an exploration based platformer games such as \textit{Spelunky}.\\

The game-play also aimed at the dynamic lighting system which changes the appearance of the ship. These dynamic lighting effects are generated  using placement of point, spot lights and normal maps for different game objects.
